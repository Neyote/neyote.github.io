### Hey, I'm Neyote.

I'm an IT Specialist at a small software development company. I usually handle system and network administration, but I'm working on breaking into security. I'm specifically interested in physical security and lockpicking, automation with Python, security system implementation/administration, and malware analysis.

I have two cats and a dog, enjoy listening to music (ask me who I'm listening to right now), and drink beer. My favorite PlayStation 2 game is Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal, and if you manage to catch me doing physical activity it's probably hockey.

I made this GitHub site to publish write-ups for the projects I'm working on but I'll probably post other content, like news. Until I have a proper domain and email you can reach me at <neyotebusiness@gmail.com>. I'll also add my social links below, feel free to shoots me a message and say hi.
