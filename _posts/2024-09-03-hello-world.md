Here's my first post. I'll write a little bit about my github site.

I'm using GitHub Pages to serve this blog. When I finished setting up my repo and Jekyll I saw that there were websites that had a ton of themes for Jekyll sites. I looked around and decided [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) would fit best. I like the minimal, dark layout of the theme. It also made it really easy to include my socials.

A lesson learned while setting this up: RTFM! I really should've checked the theme's documentation section on using it in a GitHub Pages site. I spent an evening setting it up before realizing there was an easier, specific way to import their GitHub project into my own repo. After deleting the first repo and re-doing it, my blog was born.
